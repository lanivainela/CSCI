        <p>
         One of the countries in the world being affected by Climate change is Greenland. As global temperatures rise, Greenland's ice sheets rapidly melt faster than usual. This contributes in making sea levels rise all around the world, including in places like the Marshall Islands. The warmer temperatures harm many of the animals and make it difficult for the people living there, to maintain their tractional ways of life.

   <h3>The Marshall Islands</h3>
<p>
Another country that is being affected by Climate change is the Marshall Islands. As the Earth gets warmer, the sea levels rise and can flood the islands, damaging the homes and lands of many. Since the Marshall Islands are a very low and close island to the ocean, the chances of drowning is at a high risk.

<h3>How do these two countries connect?</h3>
<p>
Now, how do these two countries connect? Both Greenland and the Marshall Islands are on the front lines of Climate change, but in very different ways. Greenland's ice is melting rapidly, causing sea levels to rise in which threatens the Marshall Islands. Both are connected as one is losing its land, and the other is drowning slowly.

  <h2>Poem "Rise" By Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and Aka Niviana</h2>
  <p>
    The poem "Rise" written by Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and Aka Niviana, uses poetry to showcase the linkages between their homelands, in the face of Climate change. The poem teaches that Climate change is a shared struggle between many people across the world. It isn't something where we remain silent and do nothing about it. Instead, it's about building up resilence and unity to fight against the dangers of Climate change.
