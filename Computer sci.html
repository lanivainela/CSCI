<h2>What is Climate change?</h2>
<p>
Climate change is define as long term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns.
  Although Climate change is a natural process, some human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have caused global warming and extreme weather events.

<h2>Impacts of Climate Change on people and the environment</h2>
<p>
Climate change affects people in many ways.
It can cause people to get sick as they are exposed to heatwaves and diseases being spread.
  It also makes it difficult to grow enough food due to the weather being unpredictable.
  Climate change can cause damages to homes and jobs, forcing people to leave their homes and lose their jobs.
</p>

<p>
Climate change has a huge impact on our environment.
  The increase of temperature causes glaciers and ice to melt, leading to higher sea levels.
  When this happens, floods appear and damages many parts of our land. Warmer temperatures also change weather patterns,
  leading to more droughts, extreme storms and floods. Animals are also affected as they may struggle to survive, due to their homes being too hot or dry.

    <h3>Greenland</h3>

        <p>
         One of the countries in the world being affected by Climate change is Greenland. As global temperatures rise, Greenland's ice sheets rapidly melt faster than usual. This contributes in making sea levels rise all around the world, including in places like the Marshall Islands. The warmer temperatures harm many of the animals and make it difficult for the people living there, to maintain their tractional ways of life.

 <article class="country">
   <h3>The Marshall Islands</h3>
<p>
Another country that is being affected by Climate change is the Marshall Islands. As the Earth gets warmer, the sea levels rise and can flood the islands, damaging the homes and lands of many. Since the Marshall Islands are a very low and close island to the ocean, the chances of drowning is at a high risk.

<article class ="country">
<h3>How do these two countries connect?</h3>
<p>
Now, how do these two countries connect? Both Greenland and the Marshall Islands are on the front lines of Climate change, but in very different ways. Greenland's ice is melting rapidly, causing sea levels to rise in which threatens the Marshall Islands. Both are connected as one is losing its land, and the other is drowning slowly.

<section id="The Poem Rise">
  <h2>Poem "Rise" By Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and Aka Niviana</h2>
  <p>
    The poem "Rise" written by Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and Aka Niviana, uses poetry to showcase the linkages between their homelands, in the face of Climate change. The poem teaches that Climate change is a shared struggle between many people across the world. It isn't something where we remain silent and do nothing about it. Instead, it's about building up resilence and unity to fight against the dangers of Climate change.
