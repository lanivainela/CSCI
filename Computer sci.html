<h2>Impacts of Climate Change on people and the environment</h2>
<p>
Climate change affects people in many ways.
It can cause people to get sick as they are exposed to heatwaves and diseases being spread.
  It also makes it difficult to grow enough food due to the weather being unpredictable.
  Climate change can cause damages to homes and jobs, forcing people to leave their homes and lose their jobs.

<p>
Climate change has a huge impact on our environment.
  The increase of temperature causes glaciers and ice to melt, leading to higher sea levels.
  When this happens, floods appear and damages a whole lot of our land. Warmer temperatures also change weather patterns,
  leading to more droughts, extreme storms and floods. Animals are also affected as they may struggle to survive, due to their homes being too hot or dry.
